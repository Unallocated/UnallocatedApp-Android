Unallocated Space
---------------------------
Unallocated Space is a technology-based community center, based out of a 1600+ 
SF space located in Severn, MD.  This space is open to the public at all times 
and is available for people to come and collaborate on their projects.  While 
we have interests ranging from electronics to woodworking, our primary focus 
tends to lie in Information Security.  Our members offer a steady stream of
talks and classes which are free and open to the public.
